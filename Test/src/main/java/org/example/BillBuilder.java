    /*
    In this extra exercise you will implement your first design pattern: a Builder.
    I don't expect you to know what a Builder is, so you will need to read carefully
    the pattern specification in Refactoring Guru:

                https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder.

    1. Understand the pattern.
    2. Read examples.
    3. Apply the pattern.
    4. Test it.

    You will have to explain your solution to the team once it is ready. Good luck! ;-D
